# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

Here are the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm :

1. **Support Vector Machine (SVM):**
   - **Strengths:**
     - High prediction accuracy and performance rate.
     - Works well with both linear and non-linear scenarios.
   - **Weaknesses:**
     - Limited to two-class (binary) classification problems.
     - Can be computationally expensive, especially with large datasets.

2. **Naive Bayes (NB):**
   - **Strengths:**
     - Simple and quick to predict the class of data.
     - Capable of handling multi-class prediction.
     - Requires less training data compared to other algorithms.
     - Performs well when the independence assumption holds.
   - **Weaknesses:**
     - Assumes feature independence, which may not hold true in real-world scenarios.
     - Can be less accurate if the independence assumption is violated.

3. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):**
   - **Strengths:**
     - Non-parametric, meaning it makes no assumptions about the underlying data distribution.
     - Simple and effective, especially in small datasets.
   - **Weaknesses:**
     - Computationally expensive during the prediction phase as it involves calculating the distance of each point in the dataset.
     - Sensitive to the choice of k (number of neighbors) and the distance metric used.

These details are drawn from the project's discussion on the algorithms applied to credit card fraud detection .
